Hybrid Low-Power Adder Architecture 

Overview
This project presents a low-power hybrid adder that combines the Accuracy-Configurable Radix-4 Adder (ACRA) with the Kogge-Stone Parallel Prefix Adder (PPA). It enables switching between approximate and accurate modes using a control signal (SAPP), optimized through power gating techniques.

Key Highlights

âœ… Configurable Accuracy with ACRA + Kogge-Stone
ðŸ”Œ Power Gating for reduced power and area
âš¡ Optimized PDP (Power-Delay Product)
ðŸ§  Validated using image smoothing (matrix multiplication)
ðŸ’¡ Suitable for: Image/Signal Processing, ML inference, and Embedded Systems

Tools Used

Xilinx ISE 14.7
Artix-7 FPGA
Verilog HDL

Applications
Ideal for error-tolerant applications where minor precision loss is acceptable in exchange for high hardware efficiency.
